Plan with mad thoughts
==========
We are thinking of a round shape robot which can move around by using the same theory as tumbler.
- A bearing in middle for motors to control movement.
There should be a cap on the top which can be lift up by dc motors.
After the cap is risen, two spooky eyes show up. (LCD creen X2).
There should be a speaker for making sounds.
There should be a remote control to control the action of the robot.

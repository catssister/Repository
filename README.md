# Spooky Ball Robot <v.0.7.0>

   The project we just to created for this term is a little and quite a spotty ball robot. It has been done was means wit have something called popular and some intelligent interaction technology. Spooky ball robot is a great way to make someone was not want to go, or he needs some activity to prove their body. This kind of robot has a very Compact structure, it uses the led screen to show the information, and he has some transport unit to let it move around. It also has a signals and system to catch the signal.
   
   
   The main idea for the robot is to use a fell motor to touch the wall and make the ball to move. Also in the ball, we have the Graphics sensor control system to receive the signal to make sure when the robot was running it does not dump over. All the message will send to the Arduino chip when something wrong he Arduino will send a signal to a piezo speaker to produce a noise. Just like a  smoke alarm in your kitchen, it tells the user you may hit against some were.

Plan with mad thoughts
==========
We are thinking of a round shape robot which can move around by using the same theory as tumbler.
- A bearing in middle for motors to control movement.
There should be a cap on the top which can be lift up by dc motors.
There should be a speaker for making sounds.
There should be a remote control to control the action of the robot.

Construction steps
===========

Step one to connect the receiver board and Arduino and put a led to test the board was work or not.
By serial output, it will be easier to check exactely how the digital signal works.
By noteing down all the values readed from different buttons, it is helperful for later coding.

Step two is to complate the motor connection with motion.(We just put on the charger to make sure both of the motor was working, when we saw it working we just take out the charger). We have not prepared a charger for the battery pack which causes a huge issue. After heavy testing, it runs out of power. So it is a good idea to prepare a charger which fit to the battery pack. The charger we ended up buying is the 6V - 12V NiMH / NiCd Smart Charger which is safer and easier to use.

Step three to build up the strcture and put the motors for both side of the stracture.

That is the step four, it is put all the structure in the ball we just bought. You can see the mortor was block on the both side.

Step 5 was to make the specker can pick up alone. we can put any were we want.

Step 6 was shows that we just try to put all the part on the frame construction.It look like we make it! :)

Build Instructions
===========
The frame was blocked inside the ball, and the power wheel motor was on the frame. The pulley and surface are connected,gear rotation drivers pulley rolling to let the ball move.In the robot also have a speaker, that speaker was connect directly to arduino board. In the middle of the frame have a gravity arm, at the bottom of it have the battery pack which is used as a weight. It powers the motors to lift itself.

<br>

Usage
===========

* Step one : Open the power supply cover. (still in imagination since we are unable find a cover fit as a cap)
* Step two : Connect the line between Arduino to the power supply.
* Step three : Connect the line between Arduino to dual motor control board.
* Step four : Connect the line between Arduino to motor board.
* Step five : Connect the power supply to the dual motor board.
* Step six : Upload codes for controlling sound, remote, led(unable to put on due to lack of working space) and motor.
* Step seven : Upload codes for controlling motion command.
* Step eight : Make sure all the lines are connect at the right place.
* Step nine : Close the lid. (still in imagination since we are unable find a cover fit as a cap)
* Step ten : Use remote contral to test each part of function does robot have.

Just play~ Don't forgot to charger the battery! Pretend it as star war sphere bot XD
